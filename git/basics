``git status``
each file can either be 'tracked' or 'untracked'

- tracked are files in the last commit or newly staged ones
- untracked are files not in the last commit and are not staged


``git add {file}``
add file or directory to be tracked, it is staged
any change since last commit needs to be staged again before next commit


``git diff``
it tells you in detail the changes made that are not yet staged
