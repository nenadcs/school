``git status``
each file can either be 'tracked' or 'untracked'

- tracked are files in the last commit or newly staged ones
- untracked are files not in the last commit and are not staged


``git add <file>``
add file or directory to be tracked, it is staged
any change since last commit needs to be staged again before next commit


``git diff``
it tells you in detail the changes made that are not yet staged


``git rm <file>``
removes the file from staging and from directory. if you simply use ``rm``
you will still need to ``git rm`` before commit
if you modified or staged the file you must ``-f`` force the removal
to unstage and keep the file in the folder ``git rm --cached <file>``


``git mv <file> <file>``
rename a file and keep it tracked
